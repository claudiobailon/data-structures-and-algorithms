## Reverse an Array
This method will reverse the order of a given array.
### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray that takes in an Array as an argument and returns that array in reversed order
### Approach & Efficiency
I wrote a for loop that ran half the length of the array and swapped the indexes of of the first element with the last, the second with the second to last, and so on until the array is in reverse order. 
### Solution

## Array Shift
This method will add a value to the middle of any given array.
### Challenge
Write a function called arrayShift that takes in an array and an int as an argument and returns an array with the int added to the array in the middle index.
### Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)<br>
Space O(n)

## Binary Search
This method will check to see if a value is in any given array.
### Challenge
Write a function called binarySearch that performs a search to see if a value is in an array. If there is, it returns the index of that value, if not, it returns -1.
