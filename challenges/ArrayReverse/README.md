# Reverse an Array
This method will reverse the order of a given array.
## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray that takes in an Array as an argument and returns that array in reversed order
## Approach & Efficiency
I wrote a for loop that ran half the length of the array and swapped the indexes of of the first element with the last, the second with the second to last, and so on until the array is in reverse order. 
## Solution
